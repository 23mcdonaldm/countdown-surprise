        <h6>8/25/23</h6>

        <h6>8/26/23</h6>

        <h6>9/3/23</h6>
        <div>well im on my bus ride home from having the best time ever with you in ny. i had nerves trying to go to sleep and i dont think i even got a second of sleep. i was shakey j thinking about seeing you again and it was only the first time in less than 2 weeks.</div>
        <h6>9/20/23</h6>
        <div>it is so much better when we're constantly talking and on good terms. favorite little part of my everyday day is looking at my phone and seeing your notis </div>

        <div>A month ago today was the most fun day but also the hardest day w u. it's funny bc it feels like it was just yesterday but then you think that it's been a month and it feels like its been more like 3 months. missing you like crazy </div>
        <h6>10/3/23</h6>
        <div>Well its been a month now since the last time i've seen you and it sucks but like its also gotten easier. i feel like weve learned a lot about eachother and we communicate a lot better now compared to a month or 2 ago</div>
        <h6>10/5/23</h6>
        <div>Well its exactly 1.5 months until i see you again and there is literally nothing in the world im more excited for. Every night after we 'hang' for hours i sit in bed with such a full heart. even if im exhausted and need sleep i rly just cant stop thinking about you. were so far away but we can still talk like nothings changed</div>
        <h6>10/6/23</h6>
        <div>This is such a hard thing to bring up but i feel like the one thing i didnt realize when i first came here was how much you trust me, even though it's difficult. i keep thinking that i really really dont know how you dont overthink things but im rly glad u do trust me. ur not wrong in trustingðŸ¤ž</div>
