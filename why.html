        <h6>8/24/23</h6>
        <div>it's only our second day apart and im sitting in my hotel room, about to go to move in and all i've been able to think about is this girl that's 2000 miles away </div>
        <h6>8/25/23</h6>
        <div>2,316 miles has nothing on us.</div>
        <h6>8/26/23</h6>
        <div>well i called you for like so long today and although i cant everyday it was nice to feel close to u again. i rly do believe.</div>
        <h6>8/30/23</h6>
        <div>hung out till 3am last night. its funny when we hang and neither of us wanna go to bed, even when were not together</div>
        <h6>9/3/23</h6>
        <div>well im on my bus ride home from having the best time ever with you in ny. i had nerves trying to go to sleep and i dont think i even got a second of sleep. i was shakey j thinking about seeing you again and it was only the first time in less than 2 weeks.</div>
        <h6>9/20/23</h6>
        <div>it is so much better when we're constantly talking and on good terms. favorite little part of my everyday day is looking at my phone and seeing your notis </div>
        <h6>9/22/23</h6>
        <div>A month ago today was the most fun day but also the hardest day w u. it's funny bc it feels like it was just yesterday but then you think that it's been a month and it feels like its been more like 3 months. missing you like crazy </div>
        <h6>10/3/23</h6>
        <div>Well its been a month now since the last time i've seen you and it sucks but like its also gotten easier. i feel like weve learned a lot about eachother and we communicate a lot better now compared to a month or 2 ago</div>
        <h6>10/5/23</h6>
        <div>Well its exactly 1.5 months until i see you again and there is literally nothing in the world im more excited for. Every night after we 'hang' for hours i sit in bed with such a full heart. even if im exhausted and need sleep i rly just cant stop thinking about you. were so far away but we can still talk like nothings changed</div>
        <h6>10/6/23</h6>
        <div>This is such a hard thing to bring up but i feel like the one thing i didnt realize when i first came here was how much you trust me, even though it's difficult. i keep thinking that i really really dont know how you dont overthink things but im rly glad u do trust me. ur not wrong in trustingðŸ¤ž</div>
